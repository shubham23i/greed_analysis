Fear vs Greed Analysis Summary

Overview - This project analyzes how trader performance and behavior
change under different market sentiment regimes (Fear vs Greed).
Historical trading data is combined with the Fear & Greed Index and
analyzed at a daily trader level.

Methodology - Trading data and sentiment data were aligned by date. -
Daily trader-level metrics were calculated, including PnL, win rate,
leverage, trade frequency, and positioning. - Results were compared
across Fear and Greed regimes. - Traders were segmented by behavior, and
an optional clustering analysis was performed.

Key Insights 1. Trader performance is stronger during Greed regimes than
Fear regimes. 2. Traders use higher leverage and trade more frequently
during Greed periods. 3. High-leverage traders are more sensitive to
sentiment changes. 4. Distinct trader behavior groups emerge when
clustering is applied.

Strategy Takeaways - Reduce leverage exposure during Fear regimes,
especially for high-risk traders. - Allow higher activity during Greed
regimes, but maintain leverage limits. - Apply different risk controls
to different trader segments.

Conclusion - Market sentiment has a measurable impact on trader behavior
and outcomes. Incorporating sentiment and trader segmentation into
decision-making can improve risk management and performance.
